# 👋 Hi there, I’m Amar Majhi (@amarmajhi09)

🚀 I'm an engineer exploring the full anatomy of next-gen intelligent machines:
- 🛠️ **CAD & EV Systems** – *The skeleton and veins of robotics*: I design the body, chassis, drivetrain, and simulate its motion and stress behavior.
- 🤖 **Robotics + ROS** – *The nervous system*: I program sensors, actuators, and robotic logic for perception, control, and mobility.
- 🧠 **AI / ML / DL / LLMs** – *The autonomous brain*: I train and deploy smart models to make robots see, learn, and decide.
- 📊 **Simulation & Analysis** – *The virtual lab*: I validate systems using ANSYS, MATLAB/Simulink, and Simscape before building them.
- 🧩 **Embedded Systems** – *The muscles & reflexes*: I work with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, and CAN bus to control real-world hardware.
